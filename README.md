# Suicide_rate

I presente here the Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 for some countries.
This compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum.
The dataset retrived from Kaggle.
